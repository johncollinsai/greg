Webapp for showcasing an AI chatbot. Greg allows a complex chatbot to be handled as a separate microservice. My project AnalystGPT (ai-analystgpt) is the chatbot microservice (note use of separate node.js email service within ai-analystgpt).

Deployed as a cloud run service https://johncollinsai-greg-voqqf4ls3a-as.a.run.app/
